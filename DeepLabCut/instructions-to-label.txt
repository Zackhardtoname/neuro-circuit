1- Launch Git bash as admin from start menu
2- In git bash, write cd C:\Users\saildlc\Documents\neuro-circuit\DeepLabCut\whiskers-the_Chen_Lab-2019-10-01
3- Run label_frames.sh using bash label_frames.sh
4- A GUI should open.
5- Click Load frames, select a folder in labeled-data directory. 
6- The GUI should load the frames. The first frame is shown.
7- Label every frame, clicking save along the way for each.
8- Quit when you need to exit.
9- If you stopped in between, just launch the script again (Steps 1-3). Please select the folder of the video, not the folder that says <video>_labeled.
10- Go back/forth once and you will re-see the labels you marked. You can move them around.
11- To add a label, once a project is ongoing, just edit the file 
	- C:\Users\saildlc\Documents\neuro-circuit\DeepLabCut\whiskers-the_Chen_Lab-2019-10-01\config.yaml directly.
	- After editing, relaunch the script using steps 1-3. The new label should appear on the sidebar.
12- To create a new project, delete the old, and from \DeepLabCut\bash_scripts run bash initiakl_setup.sh. It will take around half an hour for setup and frame generation.
